                    or discomfort which you might experience. Participating in the study might not benefit you, but we might learn things that will benefit others. You should discuss any questions you
                    have about this study with Professor Benedict Dellaert and Professor Yongdong Liu.</p>

                <b>Purpose of the study</b>
                <p>The purpose of this study is to understand more about consumer decision-making.</p>

                <b>Study design</b>
                <p>This study is designed to test theories related to how consumers form preferences about products. Information about how people form preferences will be collected from approximately 400 participants.</p>
                <b>Who can participate in the study</b>
                <p>You can participate in the study if you are an adult registered with MTurk Systems.</p>
                <p>Note: In order for you to get through the study smoothly, it is important that you have a full computer or laptop display. It would be highly inconvenient and frustrating for you to
                    attempt to do the study on a device with a small display (example: smartphones and tablets).</p>
                <b>Who will be conducting the research</b>
                <p>All aspects of this research will be conducted by Dr. Haeubl.</p>
                <b>What you will be asked to do</b>
                <p>You will first be asked to make a decision. The study will take less than 10 minutes to complete.</p>
                <b>Possible risks and discomforts</b>
                <p>Minimal risks, which may include fatigue or eye strain, may occur. The risks or discomforts anticipated are not beyond what you may expect to experience in your daily lives.</p>
                <b>Possible benefits</b>
                <p>There are no direct benefits anticipated, but you may gain insights into your own consumer decision-making.</p>
                <b>Compensation/Reimbursement</b>
                <p>You will receive <strong>$0.80</strong> as the compensation of your participation in this study. Once you complete the study, you will receive your paycode. <b class="text-danger">You
                    MUST enter the paycode correctly in order to receive your compensation.</b></p>
                <p><b>Confidentiality & Anonymity</b></p>
                <p>Your responses are anonymous and thus results will be reported with no reference to you specifically. No information that could allow the researcher to identify you personally will
                    be collected. Therefore, your responses cannot be linked to your identity. The MTurk system protects your privacy by making sure that you will only be identified to researchers
                    with a unique numeric code that the system will assign, not by your name.</p>
                <p>Once the study has been completed, all data files will be stored on an external hard drive in Professor Liu and Professor Dellaertâ€™s office for a period of 5 years, post-publication as per University of College London policy.</p>

                <p>If you have any questions regarding the study, please contact the study administrator at xxxxx@xxx.com</p>
