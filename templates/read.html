                <p>We are conducting an academic survey about customer behaviour. Imagine that to save on costs, you need to buy a pre-used book for a course. You go to an online marketplace and find
                    that there are 50 (fifty) different vendors that are offering this used book. Your task in this survey is to select the best book (achieving the highest real quality-price ratio)
                    from the online market place. Select the link below to complete the survey. At the end of the survey, you will receive a code to paste into the box below to receive credit for
                    taking our survey.
                    Make sure to leave this window open as you complete the survey. When you are finished, you will return to this page to paste the code into the box.
                    Please spend 3-5 minutes reading the instruction below before conducting your survey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are four different and parallel settings in this experiment, (Scenario 1: platform quality detection ability = Good and vendor quality uncertainty= Low; Scenario 2: platform
                    quality detection ability = Good and vendor quality uncertainty= High; Scenario 3:platform quality detection ability = Poor and vendor quality uncertainty= Low; Scenario 4:
                    platform
                    quality detection ability = Poor and vendor quality uncertainty= High) in the begining of the survey, you will be randomly directed to one of the four scenarios and will stay on
                    that
                    settings during your survey. Your aim is to choose between the products to select the one with the highest real quality-price ratio as possible.
                    Notice you can only choose ONE product each time and you are expected to shop 2-3 times under the same experiment setting.
                    The detailed instruction of the four scenarios are introduced below.
                </p>
                <b>
                    1. Scenario 1 (platform quality detection ability = Good and vendor quality uncertainty= Low)
                </b>
                <p>
                    To help your selection, each vendor indicates the price and quality condition of the book that he or she is offering for sale. Prices vary between 10 and 30 dollars. Quality also
                    varies. The quality score is on 100 point scale (0= extremely poor quality; 100 = quality is as new). However, the quality score claimed by the vendor may not be accurate.
                    Vendors may exaggerate the quality of the book by a factor anywhere in the range of 0-20%. This means that the claimed quality score may be up to 20% higher than the true quality.
                    For
                    example, a true quality score 50 could be exaggerated to any score between 50- 60 with EQUAL probability.
                    Thus, this vendor may exaggerate the score to 51 or 59 equally likely. You will not be able to observe the true quality score until you complete the purchase.
                    Sone online market places also independently verify the quality of the books that the vendors offer for sale. The platform that you are using, has replaced the vendor quality
                    rating
                    with its own independent quality rating that reduces the quality reporting error to anywhere between 0 and 10%. Thus, the quality score displayed on this site is the platform
                    verified
                    score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You receive a bonus after this survey depending on the ratio of the book’s TRUE quality and price that you purchase. For example, a book that has a true quality score of 50 points
                    and
                    costs 10 dollars (ratio = 50:10 = 5) leads to a higher extra payment than a book that has a quality score of 40 points and costs 10 dollars (ratio = 40:10 = 4). However, remember
                    that
                    the claimed quality score is may or may not be the true quality.
                    Your task is to select the book that provides the highest quality per dollar.
                    The extra payment for selecting the book with the highest quality/dollar ratio is $ 0.50, for selecting the book with the second highest ratior it is $ 0.49, for selecting the book
                    with the third highest score it is $ 0.48, etc.. If your purchase turns to be the lowest quality/dollar ratio, no bonus will be rewarded.

                    Vendors may exaggerate the quality of the book by a factor anywhere in the range of 0-50%. This means that the claimed quality score may be up to 50% higher than the true quality.
                    For
                    example, a true quality score 50 could be exaggerated to any score between 50- 75 with EQUAL probability. Thus, this vendor may exaggerate the score to 51 or 74 equally likely. You
