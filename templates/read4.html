                <p> You receive a bonus after this survey depending on the ratio of the bookâ€™s TRUE quality and price that you purchase. For example, a book that has a true quality score of 50 points
                    and costs 10 dollars (ratio = 50:10 = 5) leads to a higher extra payment than a book that has a true quality score of 40 points and costs 10 dollars (ratio = 40:10 = 4). However,
                    remember that the claimed quality score may differ from the true quality score.</p>
                <b> Your task is to select the book that provides the highest true quality per dollar. </b>
                <p> The extra payment for selecting the book with the highest true quality/dollar ratio is $ 0.50, for selecting the book with the second highest ratio it is $ 0.49, for selecting the
                    book with the third highest score it is $ 0.48, etc.. If your purchase turns out to be the one with the lowest true quality/dollar ratio, no bonus will be awarded. </p>
