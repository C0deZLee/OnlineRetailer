                    <p> To help your selection, each vendor indicates the price and quality condition of the book that he or she is offering for sale. Prices vary between 10 and 30 dollars. Quality
                        also
                        varies. The quality score is provided on a 100 point scale (0= extremely poor quality; 100 = quality is as new). However, the quality score claimed by the vendor may not be
                        fully
                        accurate. </p>
                    <p> Vendors may exaggerate the quality of the book by a factor anywhere in the range of <b>0-20%</b>. This means that the claimed quality score may be up to 20% higher than the
                        true
                        quality
                        of the book. The different exaggerated scores are provided with EQUAL probability by all vendors. For example, a true quality score of 50 could be exaggerated to any score
                        between
                        50- 60 by a vendor and the possibility that a vendor exaggerates the score to 51 or 59 is equally likely. You will not be able to observe the true quality score until you have
                        completed the purchase. </p>
                    <p> Some online market places also independently verify the quality of the books that the vendors offer for sale. The platform that you are using,<b>has replaced the vendor quality
                        rating with its own independent quality rating that reduces the quality reporting error to anywhere between 0 and 10%.</b> Thus, the quality score displayed on this site is the
                        platform verified score, which on average is closer to the true score. </p>
